# Arvato CapstoneProject

#Project Motivation

This project was done as part of fullfillment of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. The goal of the project is to identify people from
population who are most likely to be customers of a mail-order company and the predict which customers who would responde to marketing
campaigns.

#Project Dependencies
 - Sklearn
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Pickle

The project was done in two phases: 

    - Perform customer segmentation and identify clusters/segments from general population who best match mail-order company's customer base using Unsupervised Learning.
    - Identify targets for marketing campaign of the mail-order company who could possibly become their customers using Supervised Learning.

The following concepts were covered in the project: 

    Data Exploration & Cleansing
    Dimensionality Reduction
    Clustering
    Supervised Learning
    Final Model Evaluation
    Feature Importance
    Analysis of identified important features in clusters to find relevance
    Scoring and submisstion to Kaggle


The data files were provided as part of the project and are not publicly available. 

#Results

The final model had an auc_roc score of 0.759 and a Kaggle score of 0.79460 (https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers/leaderboard).
